## Exercises

- What four measures are the most important indicators of the health of the economy? What are the other leading economic indicators? Go to a financial news source to find out the status of all the economic indicators at this time. Make note of your findings and the date for purposes of comparison. How does the information inform you as an investor? Discuss with classmates the implications of the economic indicators for investing. For example, read the results of the most recent Consumer Confidence Survey at http://www.conference-board.org/economics/ConsumerConfidence.cfm. How might these survey results inform you as an investor?
- Read an article summarizing the index of leading economic indicators for May 2009 at http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aNHH_lMhARc4. How might an investor have used the reported information in making investment decisions? Survey the indexes listed in Figure 14.2 "Examples of Security Indexes". What role might each index play in choosing assets for a portfolio?
- Visit the SEC’s EDGAR site at http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. Take the tutorial to familiarize yourself with how the site works and then click on “Search for Company Filings.” Input the name of a company with publicly traded stock of interest to you. Then click on the company’s most recent annual report it filed with the SEC. Read the annual report in its entirety, including parts you don’t understand. Jot down your questions as you read as if you are thinking of buying shares in that company. What information encourages you in that decision? What information raises questions or concerns? Go to the company’s Web site and check its online documents, news, updates, and the current status of its stock. Are you further encouraged? Why or why not? Where can you go next to get data and commentary about the company as an investment opportunity?
- Survey the news sources listed in Figure 14.4 "Sample of Financial News Sources" and number the sites to rank them in order of their usefulness to you at this time. Record in your personal finance journal or My Notes your top five sources of financial information and why you chose them.
- Have you ever mistaken a press release or a blog for hard news when looking for information online? Read the interviews with journalists, bloggers, and others debating the reliability and accuracy of news disseminated through the Internet at http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/newswar/tags/reliability.html. This PBS Frontline special delves into the questions of the credibility and reliability of news information, including financial news and blogs that we access online. Commentators include Ted Koppel, Larry Kramer, Eric Schmidt, Craig Newmark, and others. Discuss with classmates the positions taken in this debate. In My Notes or your personal finance journal, write an essay expressing your own conclusions about trusting financial information you find online and using it to make personal finance decisions.
