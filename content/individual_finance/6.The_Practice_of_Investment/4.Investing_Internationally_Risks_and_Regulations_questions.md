## Exercises

- Go to the Web site of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) at http://www.iasb.org/Home.htm. What is the IASB’s mission? See http://www.iasb.org. What is the value of this mission for international investing today? What are the International Financing Reporting Standards (IFRS)? How could the IFRS strengthen the global economy and aid investors in the international markets? Read the 2009 Technical Summary at http://www.iasb.org/NR/rdonlyres/4CF78A7B-B237-402A-A031-709A687508A6/0/Framework.pdf. Write a summary of the IASB’s “Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements.” If adopted by countries in which you wish to invest, how would this framework work to your advantage? Now read Investopedia’s explanation of the differences between international accounting standards (IAS) and the generally accepted accounting standards (GAAP) used in the United States at http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/iasvsgaap.asp?viewed=1. What would be the advantage of every country having the same GAAP?
- Use the currency converters at http://www.xe.com/ucc and http://www.oanda.com/convert/classic to sample differences between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar. For example, how much is one euro worth compared to the U.S. dollar? On the foreign currency exchange what are the minimum bid and ask prices for euros? Did the price rise or fall compared to the previous day? Check foreign exchange rates at http://www.x-rates.com. Choose three currencies to compare with the American dollar (USD) and look at the tables or graphs showing the comparison history of those currencies. Which of the three currencies has been the most volatile? Which currency is presently closest to par with U.S. dollar?
- Examine the Index of Economic Freedom at http://www.heritage.org/Index. What is economic freedom? In the 2009 Index, which economies are freer than the United States? Visit the World Bank at http://www.worldbank.org and the IMF at http://www.imf.org/external/about.htm. What role do these organizations play in international finance? For example, what is the World Bank doing to help increase investment opportunities in developing countries such as the Republic of Indonesia? How does the IMF seek to strengthen the international financial markets?
