### Section 1 - Chapter Introduction

### Section 2 - Income and Expenses

- It is important to understand the sources (incomes) and uses (expenses) of funds, and the budget deficit or budget surplus that may result.
- Wages or salary is income from employment or self-employment; interest is earned by lending; a dividend is the income from owning corporate stock; and a draw is income from a partnership.
- Deficits or surpluses need to be addressed, and that means making decisions about what to do with them.
- Increasing income, reducing expenses, and borrowing are three ways to deal with budget deficits.
- Spending more, saving, and investing are three ways to deal with budget surpluses.
- Opportunity costs and sunk costs are hidden expenses that affect financial decision making.



### Section 3 - Assets

- Assets are items with economic value that can be converted to cash. You use excess liquidity or surplus cash to buy an asset and store wealth until you resell the asset.
- An asset can create income, reduce expenses, and store wealth.
- To have value as an investment, an asset must either store wealth or create income (reduce expenses); ideally, an asset can do both.
- Whatever the type of asset you choose, investing in assets or selling capital can be more profitable than selling labor.
- Selling an asset can result in a capital gain or capital loss.
- Selling capital means trading in the capital markets, which is a sellersâ€™ market. You can do this only if you have a budget surplus, or an excess of income over expenses.



### Section 4 - Debt and Equity

- Financing assets through equity means sharing ownership and whatever gains or losses that brings.
- Financing assets through borrowing and creating debt means taking on a financial obligation that must be repaid.
- Both equity and debt have costs and value.
- Both equity and debt enable you to use an asset sooner than you otherwise could and therefore to reap more of its rewards.



### Section 5 - Income and Risk

Diversifying sources of income in both the labor market and the capital markets is the best hedge against risks in any one market.
