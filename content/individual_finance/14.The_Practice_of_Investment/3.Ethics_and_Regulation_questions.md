## Exercises

- Read the Securities and Exchange Commission’s explanation of what it does at http://www.sec.gov/about/whatwedo.shtml. In what ways is the SEC your advocate as an investor? List your answers in your personal finance journal or My Notes. Disclosure, fair dealing, and transparency are the SEC’s watchwords. To what do they refer? The SEC is a complex government agency. What are its divisions? What organizations does the SEC work with? What laws does the SEC enforce? What number can you call if you have a question or complaint about your experience as an investor?
- Go to the SEC’s site on self-regulatory organizations of the securities industry at http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml. Click on an SRO and read the new rules it is making. Discuss with classmates how you would comment on them, as you are invited to do. Find out what is a national market system plan, a category of SROs. What do the National Market System (NMS) plans do? To see NMS plans in action, go to a Web site where you can see streaming ticker tape, such as Google Finance at http://www.google.com/finance. How does what you see on the streaming ticker tape relate to the regulatory environment of the world of investing?
- Debate with classmates the desirability of government regulation of the financial markets at the federal, state, and organizational levels. What impacts do regulation and deregulation have on the economy, the markets, and you as an investor? What are some concrete examples of those impacts? Write an essay declaring and supporting your position on this issue.
