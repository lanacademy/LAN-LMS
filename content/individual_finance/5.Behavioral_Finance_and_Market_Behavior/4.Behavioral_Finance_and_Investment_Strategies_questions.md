## Exercises

- Consider exploring the world of chartists at http://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/02/121702.asp and consider trying your hand at this arcane art. You and our classmates might begin by learning how to read the charts that technical analysts use to predict price changes in the markets. For a detailed glossary of chart symbols and patterns, see http://www.trending123.com/patterns/index.html. What do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of technical analysis compared to fundamental analysis?
- What is a pyramid scheme exactly? Find out at http://www.investopedia.com/articles/04/042104.asp. Have you ever participated in or invested in such a scheme? Have you ever been a victim of one? Record your answers in My Notes or your personal finance journal. According to the Investopedia article, why can it be difficult to detect a pyramid scheme? What are some possible tip-offs to this kind of fraud? Why are pyramid schemes unsustainable? Who are the victims? Draw a diagram illustrating the dynamics of pyramid schemes.
- How are investment clubs different from pyramid schemes? Read about investment clubs at http://www.ehow.com/how-does_4566462_investment-club-work.html. What does the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission have to say about investment clubs at http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/invclub.htm? Investigate further online. Would you consider joining or starting an investment club? Why, or why not? What do your classmates think about this?
- Survey the Web site of a 2009 60 Minutes CBS broadcast on the Madoff affair, which includes articles, video, and links at http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/27/60minutes/main4833667.shtml. According to this site, who discovered the Madoff fraud and how? Who were Madoff’s victims? Visit the support group Web site created for the victims at http://berniemadoffponzisupportgroup.blogspot.com/. In the CBS video, how did Madoff defend himself? Read a Wall Street Journal article at http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123111743915052731.html, explaining how Madoff’s Ponzi scheme was able to succeed. How did investor biases contribute to this success? How did biases in regulatory oversight contribute to the fraud? Sample some of the videos of the congressional hearings on the Madoff scandal at http://video.google.com/videosearch?hl=en&q=madoff+fraud&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei= vSk1Sq2iOsGHtgfduMC8CQ&sa=X&oi= video_result_group&resnum=7&ct=title#. Why did representatives and senators focus their criticism on the Securities and Exchange Commission?
