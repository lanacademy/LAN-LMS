## Exercises

- Record in My Notes or your personal finance journal your work history and current thoughts about your future work life. What jobs have you held? In each job, what experience, knowledge, or skills did you acquire or develop? What are your future job preferences, and why do you prefer them? Do you have a planned career path? What potential advantages and opportunities do your preferences or plans offer? What potential disadvantages and costs may your preferences or plans entail?
- Go online to find out the differences in definition between an occupation and a vocation, profession, trade, career, and career path. Which combination of concepts best describes the approach you plan to take to satisfy your needs for income from future employment? Sample the links at http://www.rileyguide.com/careers.html. Choose and record or bookmark the three best online sources of career information for you.
- Take a free online career development aptitude test, such as the one at http://www.careertest.us/Career_Aptitude_Survey.htm. (Note that sites offering free aptitude, personality, or job preference tests often require online registration. You should evaluate the reliability, credibility, and security of any site you use to explore your career preferences.) What personality attributes and personal aptitudes are micro factors that may affect your career choices or your chances of success in a particular job? View the kinds of assessments you may be asked to take as a job applicant or employee at http://www.ppicentral.com/Pdf/Employee_Aptitude_Survey.pdf. What aptitudes are included in the battery of tests that make up the Employee Aptitude Survey? How might an employer use the test results?
- In My Notes or your personal finance journal, list your most important job skills, aptitudes, and preferences on which you plan to expand or build a career. Then list the specific job skills you feel you need to develop further through additional education or experience. How and where will you get those skills and at what cost? Next, describe the lifestyle you hope to support through income from future employment. What aspects of that lifestyle would be easiest for you to modify or sacrifice for your career or income goals?
