## Exercises

- Prepare common-size statements for your income statement, cash flow statement, and balance sheet. What do your common-size statements reveal about your financial situation? How will your common-size statements influence your personal financial planning?
- Calculate your debt-to-income ratio and other ratios using the financial tools at Biztech (http://www.usnews.com/usnews/biztech/tools/modebtratio.htm). According to the calculation, are you carrying a healthy debt load? Why, or why not? If not, what can you do to improve your situation?
- Read a PDF document of a 2006 article by Charles Farrell in the Financial Planning Association Journal on “Personal Financial Ratios: An Elegant Roadmap to Financial Health and Retirement” at http://www.slideshare.net/Ellena98/fpa-journal-personal-financial-ratios-an-elegant-road-map. Farrell focuses on three ratios: savings to income, debt to income, and savings rate to income. Where, how, and why might these ratios appear on the chart of Common Personal Financial Ratios in this chapter?
- If you increased your income and assets and reduced your expenses and debt, your personal wealth and liquidity would grow. In My Notes or in your personal financial journal, outline a general plan for how you would use or allocate your growing wealth to further reduce your expenses and debt, to acquire more assets or improve your standard of living, and to further increase your real or potential income.
