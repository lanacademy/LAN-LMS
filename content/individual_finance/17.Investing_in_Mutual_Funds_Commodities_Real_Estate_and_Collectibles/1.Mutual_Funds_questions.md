## Exercises

- View the video “Investing in Mutual Funds” at http://efinancedirectory.com/multimedia/Investing_in_Mutual_Funds_Video.html. According to the speaker, are no-load funds free? Should you buy mutual funds near the end of a year? Survey the articles and tools at “Mutual Funds 101” on Yahoo! Finance at http://finance.yahoo.com/funds/mutual_funds_101. According to both this source and the video, what are the two key benefits of mutual funds? How are mutual funds classified? How can you gauge the performance of a mutual fund? What are the costs of owning mutual funds? Where can you get information about a mutual fund?
- Securities regulations require complete and continuous disclosure, also referred to as transparency, so that investors will know what they are getting into when they invest. This requirement is partly satisfied through a fund prospectus. Read the SEC’s advice on how to read a prospectus and what to look for at http://www.sec.gov/answers/mfprospectustips.htm. Then compare that information with the advice offered at http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/04/23/how-to-read-a-mutual-fund-prospectus/. On the same page, browse the “Best of Get Rich Slowly” links, too. How does this information reinforce the idea that you should thoroughly read and understand a prospectus before investing in a fund?
- View Morningstar’s performance data chart for various categories of mutual funds at http://news.morningstar.com/fundReturns/CategoryReturns.html. What general categories of funds are included in the chart? Over what time periods are average returns compared? On July 15, 2009, the chart identified the following funds as having average returns of more than 5 percent after five years: natural resources stock, utilities stock, Latin America stock, Pacific/Asia stock, diversified emerging markets stock, emerging markets bonds, long-term government bonds, and equity precious metals. What is the performance of those funds today?
- Read Investopedia’s article on the costs of investing in mutual funds at http://www.investopedia.com/university/mutualfunds/mutualfunds2.asp. What is your management expense ratio (MER)? Do mutual funds with higher expenses generally earn higher returns?
- Take Investopedia’s tutorial on how to read a mutual fund table in the financial news at http://www.investopedia.com/university/mutualfunds/mutualfunds4.asp. What do the columns mean? What is being compared? What can you learn from mutual fund tables that may help you choose funds or track the performance of funds you own? Share your ideas with classmates.
- In My Notes or your personal finance journal, record your study of a fund you choose to track. Read the prospectus, check its ratings, and compare its week-to-week performance with that of similar funds in the mutual funds table in the financial section of a newspaper. Record your observations, questions, and commentary as you go about deciding hypothetically whether or not to invest in that fund.
