## Content

I am very grateful to Jeff Shelstad, Mary Ellen Lepionka, Shannon Gattens, and the staff at Unnamed Publisher. Friends and family have been more than patient throughout; their faith has been unfailing and their support has been vital. I am thankful for the inspiration of several great teachers, notably Stan Gartska, Stephen A. Ross, Jon Ingersoll, and Barbara Stanhope. Most of all, I have been fortunate to have been taught by hundreds of students, of all ages and stages, from whom I have learned so much.
