## Exercises

- Brainstorm with classmates expressions or homilies relating to investing, such as you gotta pay to play; you gotta play to win; no pain, no gain; it takes money to make money; and so on. What does each of these expressions really mean? How do they relate to the concepts of investment risk and return on investment? In what ways are risks and returns in a reciprocal relationship?
- Draft an individual investment policy statement as a guide to your future investment planning. What will be the advantages of having an investment policy statement? In My Notes or your personal finance journal, record your general return objectives and specific goals at this time. What is a return objective?
- What is your level of risk tolerance? How would you rate your risk tolerance on a five-point scale (with one indicating “most risk averse”)? In your personal finance journal, record how your asset base, time horizon, and liquidity needs define your ability to undertake investment risk. Then describe the personality characteristics, past experiences, and knowledge base that you feel help shape your degree of willingness to undertake risk. Now check your beliefs by taking the Risk Tolerance Quiz at http://www.isi-su.com/new/risktol2.htm. How do the results compare with your estimate? Compare the results with the Risk Tolerance Questionnaire at Kiplinger’s (http://www.kiplinger.com/tools/riskfind.html) and other tests of risk tolerance offered on commercial Web sites. What conclusions do you draw from these tests? What percent of your investments do you now think you could put into stocks? What factor could you change that might enable you to tolerate more risk?
- In My Notes or your personal finance journal, record the constraints you face against reaching your investment goals. With what types of constraints must you reconcile your investment planning? The more you need to use your money to live and the less time you have to achieve your goals, the greater the constraints in your investment planning. Revise your statement of goals and return objectives as needed to ensure it is realistic in light of your constraints.
- In collaboration with classmates, conduct an online investigation into socially responsible investing. See the following Web sites:http://www.socialinvest.orghttp://www.greeninvestment.comhttp://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/content?oid=323855http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118239582814643063.htmlhttp://www.nolo.com/article.cfm/ObjectID/8E5E996A-B251-41C1-B1F867B8EB112ED3/catID/498F840B-0B7B-4A9A-AE102EC156E16660/104/284/164/ARTOn the basis of your investigation, outline and discuss the different forms and purposes of SRI. Which form and purpose appeal most to you and why? What investments might you make, and what investments might you specifically avoid, to express your beliefs and values? Do you think investment planning could ever have a role in bringing about social change?
