## This is a Sub Page

This is page.md in the "sub" folder.

Yep.

###Session tracking plugin with dashboard 
We want:

* 	Pages visited, quizzes taken, quiz results, reviews taken, essays taken, essay results, # of summaries made.
* 	Piwik, Open Web Analytics, or something super clever.
* 	Maybe also wiki pages viewed.
* 	We should be able to display some of the data for the current session user on dashboard

###Front end js for content pages
Part 1: highlight.js

* 	Itâ€™s mostly done just I'm unsure about the this.target crap
* 	And making the array from the keywords meta on the course page
*   Silt is cool.  So is Babylonia.  And Sumer.
Part 2: flip to wiki iframe

* 	[You might want ajax for that. ](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13613027/ajax-not-working-with-jquery-flip-plugin)

###Summarizer Plugin
I was imagining some combination of:

 * [This general interface](http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2010/06/simple-ajax-commenting-system/demo.php)
 * Just each user has a username.summary.xml
 * And this flips in and ajax replaces the left sidebar

###Core Navigation
In this case see the issue on github
