									World history is a field of historical study that emerged as a distinct academic field in the 1980s. It examines history from a global perspective. 
									World History looks for common patterns that emerge across all cultures. World historians use a thematic approach, with two major focal points: integration (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together) and difference (how patterns of world history reveal the diversity of the human experience).
